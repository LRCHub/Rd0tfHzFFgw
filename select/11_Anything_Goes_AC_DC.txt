Got a taste of a rocking band
Standing there holding out your hand
Better lock up all your doors
She's like a spinning dynamo
You're handing out the token prize
Giving you a brand new ride
Oh there she goes, she goes
And nobody knows where she goes
Banging drums, working out all fast
Heavy tune I can play it loud
You know she's blowing away all the others
You're never man enough take it on all night
You better razzle dazzle on that stage
Keep on rocking all through the night
Oh there she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
A heavy rocking tune is playing
Playing as the night rolls on
Sneaking off with the Romeo
Where she goes, nobody knows
A heavy rocking tune is playing on a flat screen color TV
Sneaking over creepy crawly, never give it up to take it out through the night
There she goes she goes, and nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
There she goes she goes, and nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
There she goes she goes, and nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
There she goes she goes, and nobody knows
Where she goes she goes
