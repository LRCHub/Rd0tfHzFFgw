In olden days a glimpse of stockings
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything goes

Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything Goes

The world has gone mad today
And goods bad today
And blacks white today
And days night today
When most guys today
That women prize today
Are just silly gigolo's

So though I'm not a great romance
I know that I'm bound to answer
When you propose
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And goods bad today
And blacks white today
And days night today
When most guys today
That women prize today
Are just silly gigolo's

So though I'm not a great romance
I know that I'm bound to answer
When you propose
Anything goes
Anything goes
