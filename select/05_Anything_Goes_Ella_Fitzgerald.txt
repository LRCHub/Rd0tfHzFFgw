In Olden Days A Glimpse Of Stocking
Was Looked On As Something Shocking
Now Heaven Knows, Anything
Goes
Good Authors Too Who Once Knew Better Words
Now Only Use Four Letter Words Writing
Prose
Anything Goes
The World Has Gone Mad Today
And Good's Bad Today
And Black's White Today
And
Day's Night Today
When Most Guys Today That Women Prize Today
Are Just Silly Gigolos
So Though I'm
Not A Great Romancer
I Know That You're Bound To Answer
When I Propose, Anything Goes
